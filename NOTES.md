# Notes

## Making a clean project refresh.

```shell

```

## Working with AWS S3, you'll need to install CMAKE, NASM and Visual Studio

- CMAKE: https://cmake.org/download/
- NASM: https://www.nasm.us
- VISUAL STUDIO: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

> After installation, ensure to add both to system PATH.
